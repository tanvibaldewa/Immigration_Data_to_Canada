# Immigration_Data_to_Canada
In this project, I tried to gain insights and summarize key findings on the population of immigrants to Canada from 1980-2013. After cleaning the data, I majorly employed matplotlib and seaborn functions to visualize the findings. The Project is divided in 4 parts: Part I: I plotted the overall immigration to Canada from 1980 -2013 using the seaborn regplot function. The result showed an upward trend in the number of immigrants to Canada. Part II: I sorted the top 5 (India, China, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Philippines and Pakistan) and least 5 (Palau, Western Sahara, Marshall Islands, New Caledonia and San Marino) immigrating countries and plotted individual countryâ€™s trend against their peers. Part III: I grouped the immigration data by continent and created a pie chart depicting the results. The results showed that more than 50% of immigrants were from Asia alone, followed by Europe and Latin America. Part IV: I tried to gain further insights on the individual countries by plotting a boxplot and a line graph of immigrants from Australia and Haiti respectively.
